# Privacy Policy for Tab Title Tamer

**Last Updated:** May 27, 2024

Thank you for using Tab Title Tamer ("the Extension"), developed by RomsKidd ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in relation to your use of the Extension.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines the limited data the Extension interacts with and how it's managed.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect (Core Extension)

For its core free features, Tab Title Tamer operates entirely locally within your browser:

* **No Browsing History:** The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit your browsing history or the content of the websites you visit (other than reading tab titles to apply your configured rules).
* **No Personal User Tracking:** We do not track your individual usage of the free features of the Extension.

## 2. Information Related to Pro Features (via ExtensionPay)

If you choose to upgrade to Tab Title Tamer Pro, the purchase process and subscription management are handled by our third-party service provider, **ExtensionPay** (which uses **Stripe** as its payment processor).

* **Information Collected by ExtensionPay/Stripe:** To process your Pro subscription, ExtensionPay and Stripe will collect necessary information, which may include:
    * Personal identifiers (such as your email address for account creation and communication).
    * Payment information (such as credit card details, handled directly and securely by Stripe).
    * Please refer to ExtensionPay's Privacy Policy and Stripe's Privacy Policy for details on how they collect, use, and protect your information. Tab Title Tamer does not directly access or store your full payment details.
* **Information Received by Tab Title Tamer from ExtensionPay:** The Tab Title Tamer extension will receive a status from ExtensionPay indicating whether you have an active Pro subscription (e.g., paid status, trial start date). This status is stored locally by the Extension on your device to unlock Pro features.
* **Use of Your Email (Pro Users):** If you become a Pro user, we may use the email address associated with your Pro account (as provided via ExtensionPay) for the following purposes:
    * To inform you about important updates to Tab Title Tamer Pro features.
    * To notify you of new Pro features or significant changes to the Extension.
    * To provide Pro-specific support if you contact us.
    We will not use this email for unrelated marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

## 3. Locally Stored Settings

Tab Title Tamer uses your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to save your preferences and configurations for the Extension. This includes:

* Global extension settings (e.g., default taming behavior, default number removal behavior, theme preference).
* Site-specific rules you create (e.g., which sites to tame, custom titles, title change conditions, number removal preferences for specific sites).
* Your Pro status (as received from ExtensionPay).

This data is stored only on your local device and is not transmitted to us or any other third party, except for the Pro status validation with ExtensionPay.

## 4. Data Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect the limited information the Extension interacts with. Locally stored settings are protected by your browser's security mechanisms. Payment information is handled by Stripe, which maintains high security standards.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not sell or rent your personal information.<br>
As mentioned, Pro subscription management and payment processing are handled by ExtensionPay and Stripe. We only share the necessary information with them to facilitate these services.

## 6. Your Choices

<ul>
    <li>You can manage your site-specific settings and global preferences within the Extension's options page.</li>
    <li>You can clear all locally stored settings for Tab Title Tamer by using the "Delete All Sites" function in the options page or by uninstalling the Extension.</li>
    <li>For Pro users, you can manage your subscription and payment details through the interface provided by ExtensionPay.</li>
</ul>

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
