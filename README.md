Tab Title Tamer
Tame those annoying tab titles and reclaim control of your tab bar!

Tab Title Tamer is a lightweight and user-friendly browser extension designed to stop the annoying, flashing, or distracting tab title changes that some websites use when you switch to another tab. Keep your browsing experience calm and focused.

Why Tab Title Tamer?
Tired of websites constantly changing their tab titles to grab your attention with messages like "Don't go!" or distracting animations? Tab Title Tamer is the solution for a more serene browsing experience.

Key Features
‚ú® Peace of Mind: No more distracting tab title animations or messages trying to lure you back. Stay focused on what you're doing without interruption.

„Çµ„Ç§„Éà Site-Specific Control: You're in charge! Easily toggle the title-taming feature on or off for any website directly from the extension's popup. Activate it only for the sites that bother you.

üöÄ Lightweight & Efficient: Designed to be unobtrusive and not slow down your browsing.

üëç Simple to Use: A clean, straightforward interface. Click the icon, flip the switch for the current site, and enjoy a more stable tab bar.

üîí Privacy-Focused: Tab Title Tamer works locally in your browser. It doesn't track your browsing history or send any data. Your settings are saved locally for each site you configure.

How It Works
When activated for a specific website, Tab Title Tamer intelligently monitors the tab's title. If the site tries to change the title while the tab is inactive (in the background), Tab Title Tamer steps in to keep the original, relevant title displayed.
